## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

This project has been heavily optimized for performance:

### Implemented Optimizations

- **No Lazy Loading**: All components load immediately for instant navigation
- **Minimal Animations**: Reduced complex animations that cause scroll lag
- **Optimized Styling**: Removed heavy backdrop filters and complex gradients
- **Efficient Forms**: Optimized form rendering with reduced re-renders
- **Smart Auto-Save**: Form saves every 3 seconds instead of every keystroke
- **Simplified Components**: Reduced CSS complexity for faster rendering

### Performance Metrics

- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3s

### Performance Best Practices

1. Keep animations minimal and hardware-accelerated
2. Avoid backdrop filters on large elements
3. Use CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties
4. Minimize re-renders with proper React patterns
5. Optimize images and use appropriate formats

## 🤝 Contributing

4. User can then access onboarding form
5. After form completion, redirects to Calendly for booking

### Local Storage

The app uses localStorage for:

- Onboarding form progress (auto-saved every 3 seconds)
- Form data persistence across page refreshes
- User progress tracking

### Browser Support

- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
